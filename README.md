    - By default 5 quests before Silver Hand
    - By default 3 quests before Blood's Honor
- Tell Aela the Giant was dead before you even got there
- Allows you to set a minimum player level to meet before each story quest (not implemented)
- Allows you to take more than one radiant quest at a time (Not implemented, maybe not possible)

## New Radiant Quests

New radiant quests are added to give a little bit more of diversity to the game. Since we removed Hired Muscle, we need to assign a new one to Farkas, and Aela should have more than just Animal extermination stuff.

### Farkas
- Hai

### Aela
