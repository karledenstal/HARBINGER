# HARBINGER - Companions of Ysgramor

A mod that aims to enhance the Companions faction in Skyrim SE. The goal of this mod is to remain true to vanilla and make tweaks and add gameplay elements to make the faction questline nicer to progress through.

## Current implementation

- No more "Hired muscle" radiant quest given by Farkas
- Both Aela & Farkas can be your shield-sibling in Proving Honor
- Changes to Radiant quest requirements (values can be changed in MCM)
    - By default 2 quests before Proving Honor
    - By default 5 quests before Silver Hand
    - By default 3 quests before Blood's Honor
- Restores Aelas Animal pelt radiant quest
- Tell Aela the Giant was dead before you even got there
- Allows you to set a minimum player level to meet before each story quest
    - By default set to min level 1 for every story quest
- Radiant questgiver won't stand around waiting all day for you
- Better radiant quest rewards. (Not implemented)
    - Set base gold reward for Radiant quests
